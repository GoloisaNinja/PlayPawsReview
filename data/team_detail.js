		bio: `Millie is a Frenchie with a big personality. 
    She enjoys crime dramas and documentaries as well as
    any film or movie that shows yummy food like steak or 
    chickem. She dislikes films with animals because those 
    animals are clearly trying to invade her home and she will
     not stand for that.`,

		altImage: `an amazing picture of a blue French Bulldog named Blueberry doing a professional pose for the camera`,
		name: 'Blueberry',
		genres: ['Comedy', 'Romance', 'Horror'],
		bio: `Blueberry is quite a bit older than her upstart counterpart. 
    As such, she is less inclined to be impressed by your lame indie movie
    about the benefits of friendship. On the other hand, there's very little
    that impresses the Blueberry, also know as "Boomberry" for her booming
    snores during reviews.`,
